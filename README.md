# Security Code - Web Vulnerability Protection

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive security code library aimed at protecting web applications from common vulnerabilities, including **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **SQL Injection**. It provides a set of tools and best practices to secure your application from malicious activities that can compromise user data and system integrity.

## Features
- **CSRF Protection**: Implements secure anti-CSRF tokens to prevent unauthorized requests from malicious websites.
- **XSS Prevention**: Includes input validation and output encoding strategies to mitigate the risk of client-side code injection.
- **SQL Injection Defense**: Utilizes parameterized queries and prepared statements to ensure safe database interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Language/Framework] used Node.js/express.js
- [Database] setup (MySQl)


Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

	•	Uses secure tokens to validate the authenticity of user requests.
	•	Tokens are generated per session and included in forms and headers.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

	•	Ensures all user inputs are properly sanitized and encoded before being rendered.
	•	Utilizes content security policies (CSP) to restrict the loading of untrusted scripts.

3. SQL Injection

	•	Relies on parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed.
	•	Input validation is applied to all user-provided data before processing.

Best Practices

	•	Always validate and sanitize user inputs.
	•	Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
	•	Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
	•	Regularly update dependencies to fix known vulnerabilities.
